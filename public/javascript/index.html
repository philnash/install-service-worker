  <h1>Service worker installation methods</h1>

  <p>This small app shows the different ways you can install a service worker.
  When service workers were first released you needed to use the JavaScript API,
  but Chrome 54 shipped two new methods, installation via the HTML
  <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element or by an HTTP <code>Link</code> header.</p>

  <p>See below for the various methods to install a service worker that is
  available at <code>/sw.js</code> with a scope of <code>"/"</code>.</p>

  <h2>JavaScript installation</h2>

  <p>The original and best for cross browser compatibility, responding to errors
  and doing advanced work with a service worker registration, like subscribing
  to push notifications:</p>

  <pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js", { scope: "/" })</code></pre>

  <p>Check the console for a message from the installing service worker and
  inspect the source of this page to see the code used.</p>

  <script>
    navigator.serviceWorker.register("/javascript/sw.js", { scope: "/javascript/" });
  </script>
